description: "How this website is built? And why?"

I had a brief experience with Wordpress and It was enough for me to wish I hadn't. These content management systems (OCM) aren't for me, although I get its success and audience. I felt trapped and **restrained**, it was like using Windows...

I don't remember exactly what I was googling when I've found out about [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), It was probably something about creating a personal blog **fast** ~~'cause it was about time for me to have one!~~

Soon I start Reading [the tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) I already knew *"This is it!"*, I'll create content while learning all _cool stuff_ orbitating Gatsby, like:
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- Stylesheet built with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) (this feature is optional, not related with Gatsby itself)
- Static PWA (Progressive Web Apps)

For an even smoothier experience I've used [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen), a lightweight and mobile-first starter for creating blogs with Gatsby. It works as a very well made boilerplate, [there are others](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/) but the *lightweight* and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) built-in support got my attention.

This whole website is in [Github](todo) and for now with minimal changes in Lumen default-style. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) was used for deployment (pretty much as described in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhqQ2ZW1sc) excelent Gatsby Crash Course).
